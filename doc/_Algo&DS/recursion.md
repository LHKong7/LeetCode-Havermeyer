# Recursion



## Basic Knowledge

All recursive algorithms must have the following:

- Base Case (when to stop)
- Work toward Base Case
- Recursive Call (call ourselves)

The "work toword base case" is where we make the problem simpler. The recursive call, is where we use the same algo to solve a simpler version of the problem. The base case is the solution to the "simplest" possible problem



## Why Recursion Works

In a recursive algorithm, the computer "remembers" every previous state of the problem. This information is "held" by the computer on a **"activation stack"** (i.e. inside of each function workspace)

Every function has its own workspace PER CALL of the function.
